This project aims to help fellow Japanese media / Anime / Manga fans find and
binge on new series. They can simply enter a keyword into the search bar,
whether it be author, title, or series title, and they can find all media
relating to that. Helps fans discover other works in series that they might now
otherwise know about.

(Trying) to use the myanimelist api, the MangaEden api, anime news network api. 

UPDATE: It looks like anime news network will work the best, however we will
need to parse its xml taken from api requests via beautiful soup.
